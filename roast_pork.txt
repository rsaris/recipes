3 lb boneless pork roast

3 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp salt
2 tbsp pepper
2 tbsp minced fresh basil
2 tbsp oregano
1 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes

2 tbsp olive oil

water (as needed)

10-12 italian rolls
10-12 slices provolone cheese

prepared broccoli rabe (blanch and saute with oil and garlic)

0. Preheat oven to 350.
1. Mix garlic, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes then add the oil and mix / muddle well. Score the roast and coat with rub.
2. Place the roast in a 9x13 pyrex pan and put into the oven.
3. After about 15 minutes (when the juices start running and fat starts to melt) add water up to about 1/2 inch up the pan.
4. Check every 30 minutes or so and add water as needed, when water is added, pour some over the roast to keep the top from getting dry.
5. Roast until the internal temperature reads 165-170 (about 1.5 hours total).
6. Remove roast from pan, thicken gravy by making a roux and adding slowly to the juices at the bottom of the pan.
7. Trim all visible fat and slice thin, preferably in the pan to keep all the juices. Place sliced pork into gravy.

Build sandwich with healthy amounts of pork and broccoli rabe topped with gravy, adding provolone cheese if desired.

NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:
1. Possibly remove the basil and crushed red pepper flakes and reduce black pepper to make the taste a bit more simple.
2. Find a way to increase the amount of gravy (maybe supplement w/ gravy packets).
3. Watch the temperature, cooked for 1.5 hours and ended up drying it out a bit.
