0. Preheat oven to 350.
1. Mix garlic, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes then add the oil and mix / muddle well. Score the roast and coat with rub.
2. Place the roast in a 9x13 pyrex pan and roast.
3. After about 15 minutes (until the juices start running and fat starts to melt) add water up to about 1/2 inch up the pan.
4. Check every 30 minutes or so and add water as needed, when water is added, pour some over the roast to keep the top from getting dry.
5. Roast until the internal temperature reads 165-170 (about 1.5 hours total)
6. Trim all visible fat and slice thin, preferably in the pan to keep all the juices.
7. Once done, the juices / gravy at the bottom should be golden brown with flecks of garlic and meat.
8. If needed, thicken the gravy with flour or cornstarch.
