## Ingredients 

* 3 cups fresh mint leaves (no seeds or stems)
* 1 cup milk
* 2 cups heavy cream (divided in half)
* 2/3 cup sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 6 egg yolks
* 6 oz dark chocolate
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 cup milk, 1 cup heavy cream, and 3 cups mint leaves in a heavy sauce pan. Heat until just steaming (do not let it boil)
1. Remove mixture from heat, cover, and let stand for 30 minutes
1. Reheat the mixture until steaming, remove, cover, and let stand for another 15 minutes
1. While steeping, chill rest of heavy cream in a metal bowl sitting in an ice bath
1. Once steeped, strain out the mint leaves and pour the milk into a bowl, pressing on the leaves to extract all the milk. Return this mixture to the heavy sauce pan
1. Add the sugar and salt to the steeped milk / cream mixture in the heavy sauce pan
1. Heat sauce pan mixture until it is steaming (careful not to let it boil) and mix until the sugar has fully dissolved
1. Whisk egg yolks in a medium sized bowl. Slowly pour heated cream mixture into egg mixture, careful to keep whisking so the eggs are tempered by, but not cooked by, the cream mixture
1. Scrape this mixture back into the heavy sauce pan
1. Heat mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon until mixture thickens and you can pull the spoon out and run a finger along it and it leaves clean lines (~10 minutes)
1. Strain the custard mixture and pour into cold cream
1. Chill mixture in the fridge for at least a couple hours
1. Proccess ice cream in ice cream machine
1. While ice cream is processing, melt chocolate in double boiler, adding 1 tbsp vegetable oil to make it flow.
1. Drizzle the chocolate into the ice cream machine while it processes to add a good ribbon of chocolate to the ice cream. This should happen while the ice cream is still soft but not completely set yet.
