# Devils food cake
## Ingredients

* 3 oz good-quality unsweetened chocolate
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2 1/4 cups (packed) dark brown sugar
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 4 tbsp cornstarch
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1 cup boiling water
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* One jar of raspberry jam

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
1. Create "cake flour" by mixing flour (2 cups) and cornstarch (4 tbsp) and filter through a sift into a bowl.
1. Put a pot of water on to boil so we'll have at least a cup for later.
1. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside.
1. Cream the butter and brown sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the melted chocolate.
1. Combine the flour, baking soda, and the salt. Alternating between the two, add the flour mixture and the buttermilk to the chocolate mixture in three stages, ending with flour. Then slowly stir in the boiling water and the vanilla.
1. Pour the batter into the two prepared pans, and bake until a toothpick insert in the center of a layer comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
1. Remove the pans from the oven and let the layers sit for 5 minutes. Then invert the pans over wire racks, releasing the cake, and let the cake cool completely before icing.
1. Split the cakes in half and layer them with jelly between each layer.
1. Ice the cake and serve.
