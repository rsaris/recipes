Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup rice krispies (broken up by hand)
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 cup peanut butter
5oz unsalted butter (salted is OK)
12 oz semi sweet chocolate chips

Steps:
1. Mix broken up rice krispies (1 1/2 cup) with 1 cup confectioners sugar.
2. Heat up peanut butter (1 cup) and unsalted butter (5 oz) for 45 seconds in the microwave. Mix well.
3. Mix peanut butter mixture with rice krispie mixture.
4. Place mixture into fridge (or freezer) to allow it to solidify a bit (~20-30 minutes).
5. Prepare chocolate by heating in a double boiler until liquified (can do in batches).
6. Roll peanut butter mixture into 1 inch balls.
7. Coat peanut butter balls in chocolate and place on plate with parchment paper.
8. Place coated peanut butter balls in freezer for ~10 minutes. Store in fridge after.

Possible improvements:
Move to milk chocolate instead of semi sweet? Is dark chocolate crazy?
