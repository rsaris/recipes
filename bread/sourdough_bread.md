# Sourdough bread

## The starter
Every week or so:
1. Take the starter out of the fridge and discard all but 25g.
1. Add 100g of warm water and 100g of flour (50g all purpose, 50g bread flour) and stir until it is fully incorporated
1. Let it stand partially covered (with a towel) for a few hours until it is getting bubbly.
1. Seal it up and put it back into the fridge.

## The levian (9am, bake day - 1)
1. A few days before your bake day, take your starter out of the fridge, let it warm up and feed it like above once a day (generally I do this in the morning). It should be growing well each day.
1. When the starter is at it's peak, take 25g starter and mix it with 50g warm water and 50g flour (25g all purpose and 25g bread).
1. At this point you may want to take some of the remaining starter, feed it as above, let it rest, and put it in the fridge for the next bake day.
1. Let this sit somewhere warm for about 5 hours (oven with the light on works).

## The dough (2:00pm, bake day - 1)
1. Put 300g bread flour and 150g all purpose flour in a big bowl and mix together.
1. Put 10g salt on one side of the flour mixture, pour the levian onto the other side (try and avoid letting the levian touch the salt as it will kill the yeast).
1. Pour in 300g warm water and mix. This is what works for my flour -- if it doesn't feel right (it should be sticky but not too sticky, you'll get a feel for it) add more water and note how much your mixture needs to feel right and use that amount next time (higher protein flour needs more water).
1. Let this sit in a warm place for 4 hours. Every 45 minutes or so, pull the dough out and stretch it out until it is just about to break and fold it over itself. Rotate and stretch and fold it two more times.
1. After 4 hours it should roughly double in size.

## The loaves (6:30pm, bake day - 1)
1. Place a towel in a bowl and flour it generously.
1. Spill the dough onto an unfloured surface.
1. While rotating, pull the sides up and in on itself to tighten the dough up and create a seam.
1. To tighten the skin, put the dough seam side down and gently pull from the far side towards yourself, letting the friction of the bottom of the ball stretch but not break the skin.
1. Place the dough ball seam side up in the bowl.
1. Flour the top of the dough and fold the towel over to cover the dough.
1. Put this in the fridge and let it sit for 12-15 hours.

## The bake (9am, bake day)
1. Take the dough out of the oven at least 30 minutes before you plan on baking (preferably about an hour)
1. Preheat the oven to 500f with the dutch oven in the oven. Let this sit for at least 30 minutes.
1. Retrieve a sheet of parchment paper that will cover the bottom and sides of the dutch oven. Unfold the towel and place the parchment paper over the bowl.
1. Gently flip the dough out onto the parchment paper, remove the bowl and slowly remove the towel from the dough.
1. Slash the dough in a special pattern, make sure the knife is sharp and the cuts are deep.
1. Using the parchment paper, put the dough into the dutch oven.
1. Place the dutch oven into the oven with the top on for 30 minutes.
1. Take the cover off the dutch oven, lower the oven to 450, and bake for 20 more minutes until the crust is nice and there is a hollow knock on the bottom of the loaf.
1. Put the loaf on a cooling rack for at least 1 hour before cutting into it.

# Variants

## Cinnamon raisin
1. After making the dough, add 80g raisins, 7g cinnamon, and 2 tbsp melted butter.

## Olive oil
1. After making the dough, add 15g olive oil to make it a bit more dense and last a bit longer

## Rosemary bread
1. After making the dough, add 20g olive oil and 15g chopped fresh rosemary.

## Smaller loaves
1. If you reduce the ingredients to 80% of the normal amounts and bake for 25m / 20m it comes out just as good! This turns into:
    * 20g starter, 40g flour, and 40g water for the levian
    * 240g bread flour, 120g all purpose flour, 8g salt, and 240g+ water for the dough
    
## Rolls
To make smaller dinner rolls, we can follow a similar process with a few changes.

1. Make a double batch of the smaller loaves dough (40g starter, 80g flour, 80g water for levian; 480g bread, 240g AP, 16g salt, and 480g water for dough) and add 30g olive oil.
1. Instead of shaping the dough, leave the dough in the bowl over night.
1. The morning of the bake, cut the dough into 10 equally sized pieces and make balls (like you would with the normal dough, just smaller).
1. Oil and flour the bottom of a pyrex dish and place the balls in (I had success with two x patterns in a 9x13)
1. Place a baking sheet in the oven on the bottom rack of the oven and pour in a cup of water in it. Bake the rolls at 475 for 30 minutes.
1. Let the rolls cool on a cooling rack.
