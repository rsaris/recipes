# Sourdough bread

## The starter
Every week or so:
1. Take the starter out of the fridge and discard all but 25g.
1. Add 110g of warm water and 100g of flour (50g all purpose, 50g rye) and stir until it is fully incorporated
1. Let it stand partially covered (with a towel) for about 4 hours until it is getting bubbly.
1. Seal it up and put it back into the fridge.

## The levian (9am, bake day - 1)
1. A few days before your bake day, take your starter out of the fridge, let it warm up and feed it like above one a day. It should be growing well each day.
1. When the starter is at it's peak, take 25g starter and mix it with 50g warm water and 50g flour (25g all purpose and 25g bread).
1. At this point you may want to take some of the remaining starter, feed it as above, let it rest, and put it in the fridge for the next bake day.
1. Let this sit somewhere warm for about 5 hours (oven with the light on works).

## The autolyse (2pm, bake day - 1)
1. Mix 300g bread flour and 150g all purpose flour together until they are incoporated.
1. Add 330g water at 90-95f.
1. Mix well.

## The dough (2:30pm, bake day - 1)
1. Sprinkle 10g salt over the autolyse and lay the levian on top. With a wet hand, dimple the levian into the autolyse.
1. Pinch and mix the levian into the autolyse until it is incorporated (try not to over work the dough here).
1. Let this sit in a warm place for 4 hours. Every 45 minutes or so, pull the dough out and stretch it out until it is just about to break and fold it over itself. Rotate and stretch and fold it two more times.
1. After 4 hours it should roughly double in size.

## The loaves (6:30pm, bake day - 1)
1. Spill the dough onto an unfloured surface.
1. Fold the sides of the dough while rotating. This will create a ball with a seam on the bottom.
1. To tighten the skin, put the dough seem side down and gently pull from the far side towards yourself, letting the friction of the bottom of the ball stretch but not break the skin.
1. Place a towel in a bowl and flour it generously.
1. Place the dough ball seem side up in the bowl.
1. Flour the top of the dough and fold the towel over to cover the dough.
1. Put this in the fridge and let it sit for 12-15 hours.

## The bake (9am, bake day)
1. Preheat the oven to 500f with the dutch oven in the oven. Let this sit for at least 30 minutes.
1. Retrieve a sheet of parchment paper that will cover the bottom and sides of the dutch oven.
1. When the oven is ready, take the dough out of the fridge. Unfold the towel and place the parchment paper over the bowl.
1. Gently flip the dough out onto the parchment paper, remove the bowl and slowly remove the towel from the dough.
1. Slash the dough in a special pattern, make sure the knife is sharp and the cuts are deep.
1. Using the parchment paper, put the dough into the dutch oven.
1. Place the dutch oven into the oven with the top on for 25 minutes.
1. Take the cover off the dutch oven, lower the oven to 475, and bake for 20-30 more minutes until the crust is nice and there is a hollow knock on the bottom of the loaf.
1. Put the loaf on a cooling rack for at least 1 hour before cutting into it.
